<h2>Loosely Coupled</h2>
- We should prefer to make our application loosly copuled

- Encapsulate
- The relationships between classes
- Interfaces

<h2>We have the following topics</h2>
- Inheritance
- Composition
- Favour Composition over Inhertitance


<h2>Inheritance and Composition</h2>
- Inheritance (Is-a) relationship
- Composition (Has-a) relationship

Inheritance:
- Pros: Code re-use, easier to understand
- Cons: Tightly coupled, fragile, van be abused

Composition
- pros: Code re-use, great flexibility, loose coupling
- Cons: A little harder to understand
